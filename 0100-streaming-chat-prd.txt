# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Feature: Real-time Streaming Chat Responses
- **ID:** 0100
- **Version:** 1.0 (File Version: 00)

---

### 1. Problem Statement
When the AI is generating a long response, the user has to wait without any feedback, which can feel slow and unresponsive. The user doesn't know if the system is working or has hung.

### 2. Proposed Solution
Implement a streaming connection between the frontend and backend. The backend will use the Ollama API's streaming capability to send back the AI's response token-by-token. The frontend will receive these tokens and append them to the chat window in real-time, showing the message as it's being generated.

### 3. User Stories
- As a user, I can see the AI's response appear word-by-word so that I get immediate feedback and can start reading before the full response is complete.
- As a user, I can see a typing indicator while the AI is generating the response so that I know the system is actively working on my request.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The backend must have a new API endpoint (e.g., `/api/chat/stream`) that supports Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- [ ] The frontend JavaScript must be able to connect to the streaming endpoint and handle the incoming events.
- [ ] AI response text should be smoothly appended to the message bubble in the chat UI as tokens arrive.
- [ ] The user experience should feel significantly more responsive for long-form answers.
- [ ] The existing non-streaming chat functionality should remain as a fallback or be fully replaced.
