# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Feature: Extensible Plugin Architecture
- **ID:** 1000
- **Version:** 1.0 (File Version: 00)

---

### 1. Problem Statement
The application is currently a monolith. Adding new functionality requires modifying the core codebase, which is slow and risky. To accelerate development and allow for customization, there needs to be a way for new features to be added as self-contained, independent modules.

### 2. Proposed Solution
Refactor the application to support a plugin architecture. Define a clear API for plugins to register themselves and their capabilities (e.g., new chat commands, new API endpoints, new UI components). The core application will be responsible for discovering, loading, and isolating these plugins. This could use a standard Python entry point system or a custom directory-based loading mechanism.

### 3. User Stories
- As a core developer, I can build new features as isolated plugins without altering the main application code.
- As a third-party developer, I can create a plugin to integrate the assistant with my company's proprietary tools.
- As an administrator, I can install or uninstall plugins through a simple interface to customize the application's functionality.
- As an administrator, I can see a list of installed plugins and their current status (e.g., active, disabled, error).

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A clear and well-documented Plugin API is defined.
- [ ] The core application can discover and load plugins from a designated directory at startup.
- [ ] Plugins can register new API routes and backend functionalities.
- [ ] Plugins can add new UI elements or pages to the frontend (e.g., by providing their own templates and static assets).
- [ ] The system is robust against faulty plugins; an error in one plugin should not crash the entire application.
- [ ] At least one existing feature (e.g., the Command Library) is refactored to be an independent plugin as a proof of concept.
