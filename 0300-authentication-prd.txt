# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Feature: User Authentication
- **ID:** 0300
- **Version:** 1.0 (File Version: 00)

---

### 1. Problem Statement
The application is currently open to anyone and has no concept of individual users. This prevents personalization, secure access, and the ability to assign different permissions to different people.

### 2. Proposed Solution
Implement a user authentication system. This will involve creating a user database model (to store usernames and hashed passwords), a login page, and backend endpoints for registration, login, and logout. User sessions will be managed using Flask-Login or a similar library to protect routes and associate activity with a specific user.

### 3. User Stories
- As an administrator, I can create user accounts so that I can grant access to the application.
- As a user, I can register for an account using a username and password.
- As a user, I can log in to the application to access its features.
- As a user, I can log out of the application to end my session securely.
- As an unauthenticated user, I am redirected to the login page when trying to access protected areas.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User model with fields for username, email, and password (hashed) is created in the database.
- [ ] A registration page and backend endpoint are created to allow new users to sign up.
- [ ] A login page and backend endpoint are created to authenticate users.
- [ ] A logout mechanism is implemented.
- [ ] Core application pages (like `/chat` and `/documents`) must be protected, requiring a user to be logged in.
- [ ] The application correctly handles user sessions across requests.
