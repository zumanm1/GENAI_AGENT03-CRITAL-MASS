### Status: Completed

### Notes:

- Implemented web scraper connector (`src/rag/web_scraper.py`) that ingests online documentation into ChromaDB.
- Added `/api/rag/scrape` admin endpoint to trigger scraping jobs.
- Chat backend now retrieves top-k documents from vector store to enrich prompts.
- Added dependencies (`chromadb`, `sentence-transformers`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`).
- Added `/rag-management` page for admins to view ingested documents and trigger new scrapes.
- Feature 0900 is considered complete for v1.

Next: monitoring-API connector, management UI, additional unit tests.
