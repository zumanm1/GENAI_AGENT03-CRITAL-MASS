## Feature: Extensible Plugin Architecture
- **ID:** 1000

---

### Status: Completed

### Notes:
- Implemented simple plugin loader (`src/plugins/plugin_loader.py`).
- Added `plugins` directory and converted Command Library into `command_library_plugin.py` plugin.
- Old `/library` route renamed to `/library-old` to avoid conflict.
- `simple_app.py` now auto-discovers and loads plugins at startup.
- The loader now records the status of all discovered plugins.
- Added `/plugin-management` page for admins to view the status of loaded plugins.
- Feature 1000 is considered complete for v1.
