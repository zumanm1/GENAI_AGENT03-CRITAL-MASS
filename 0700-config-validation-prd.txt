## Feature: Configuration Validation and Dry-Run
- **ID:** 0700
- **Version:** 1.0 (File Version: 00)

---

### 1. Problem Statement
Applying incorrect or incomplete configurations to network devices can cause outages. Before pushing changes, operators need confidence that the configuration is syntactically correct and will have the intended effect.

### 2. Proposed Solution
Integrate a configuration validation engine. When a user provides a configuration snippet (either by uploading a file or through chat), the AI assistant will:
1.  Identify the device type (e.g., Cisco IOS, Arista EOS).
2.  Check the configuration for syntax errors against a known schema or by using a validation library (e.g., Batfish, Scrapli).
3.  Perform a "dry-run" analysis to predict what changes the configuration will make to the device's state.
4.  Present the validation results and the predicted changes to the user for confirmation before any real deployment.

### 3. User Stories
- As a network engineer, I can submit a configuration file and have the AI validate its syntax before I deploy it.
- As a network engineer, I can see a summary of the changes (e.g., "this will add 2 VLANs and modify 1 interface") that my configuration will make.
- As a network engineer, I can receive warnings about potential issues or deprecated commands in my configuration.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The system can ingest a network configuration snippet or file.
- [ ] The system can correctly identify the network device OS for the given configuration.
- [ ] The backend includes a library or service for syntax validation (e.g., integrating an open-source tool).
- [ ] The AI provides a clear, human-readable summary of the validation results (pass/fail) and any errors found.
- [ ] The AI provides a "dry-run" report detailing the predicted operational changes.
- [ ] The validation is performed in a safe, isolated environment and does not touch any live network devices.
