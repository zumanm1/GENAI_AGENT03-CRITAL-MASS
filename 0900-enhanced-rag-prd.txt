# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Feature: Enhanced RAG with More Data Sources
- **ID:** 0900
- **Version:** 1.0 (File Version: 00)

---

### 1. Problem Statement
The current RAG system is limited to single, user-uploaded text, PDF, CSV, and Excel files. To answer complex questions accurately, the AI needs access to a wider and more persistent set of contextual information, such as vendor documentation, internal knowledge bases, and real-time monitoring data.

### 2. Proposed Solution
Expand the RAG system to create and manage a persistent vector database. Implement data connectors that can ingest and process information from various sources:
1.  **Web Scraping:** A connector to scrape and index online vendor documentation.
2.  **API Integration:** Connectors to pull data from network monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Zabbix) or other internal tools.
3.  **Managed File Store:** Allow administrators to upload a corpus of documents (manuals, best practices) that are available to all users.

### 3. User Stories
- As an administrator, I can configure a web scraper to index the documentation for a specific network OS.
- As an administrator, I can upload a collection of internal best-practice documents to the system's knowledge base.
- As a network operator, when I ask a question, the AI can draw on official vendor documentation and internal guides to provide a more accurate and comprehensive answer.
- As a network operator, I can ask questions about recent network events (e.g., "why did latency spike on router-3 last night?"), and the AI can use data from monitoring systems to answer.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A persistent vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS) is integrated into the application.
- [ ] A data ingestion pipeline is created to process documents and store them in the vector database.
- [ ] At least one new data connector is built (e.g., for a public documentation website).
- [ ] The chat backend is updated to query the vector database for relevant context before calling the AI model.
- [ ] An admin interface is provided for managing data sources and triggering ingestion jobs.
- [ ] The quality and relevance of AI answers to complex questions are demonstrably improved.
