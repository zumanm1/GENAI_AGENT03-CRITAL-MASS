## Feature: Visual Network Topology Mapping
- **ID:** 0800

---

### Status: Completed

### Notes:
- Added `network_map.html` page with Cytoscape.js visualization.
- Added `/network-map` route and `/api/network/topology` endpoint returning mock topology.
- Created `src/network/topology.py` for topology provider.
- Added `NetworkDevice` and `NetworkLink` models to the database.
- Created a database seeding function to populate the topology with mock data on startup.
- The `/api/network/topology` endpoint now fetches data from the database, making the map dynamic.
- The `/network-map` page now displays the database-driven topology.
- Feature 0800 is considered complete for v1.

Next: integrate real discovery data, allow filtering, unit tests.
